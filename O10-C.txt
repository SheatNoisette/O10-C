! look
+ There's a very large and fancy circle table at the center of the room. On this table, there are computers, some electronic devices, pieces of papers, and two giant TV screens. Oh, god, you've never seen screens that big. There's also a board on your right, and a metal closet on your left. At the back of the room stands an arcade machine.
